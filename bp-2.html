    <h3 class="head3">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="formatp">
        I had actually sketched a rough proof of my claim $($but had not done the construction$)$ like $9-10$ months ago but I don't know why I felt like writing a formal solution after a long time, lmao. It's a cute problem overall, with difficulty umm, I'd say d$3$-ish. I came across this problem in one of the blogs by <i>Shreeansh Hota</i>, so he had written ISI UG-B last year and had shared the solutions on his blog. The basic idea in his solution and mine are pretty much the same accept for the construction style $($he didn't give a construction, he actually had an increment argument$)$.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="head3">Problem</h3>
    <p class="formatp">
        $($<font color="magenta"> ISI UG-B, $2023$</font> $)$ Determine all integers $n>1$ such that every power of $n$ has an odd number of digits.
    </p>

    <h3 class="head3">Solution</h3>

    <p class="formatp">
    For convenience call a number $n\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge1}$ <i>froggy</i> if every power of $n$ has an odd number of digits in base $10$ representation. We claim that a natural $n$ is froggy if and only if it's of the form $\fbox{$10^{\ell}$}$ where $\ell$ is a natural and $2\lvert\ell$.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px;" class="formatp">
    The backward directional statement of the claim is trivial so we don't pay much attention to that. To prove the other direction, we assume that $n$ is not a power of $10$. So for $n$ to be called froggy, it has to satisfy the following inequality for any choice of $k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 1}$;
    $$10^{2m} &lt n^k &lt 10^{2m+1}; \quad \text{where $m\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 1}$}$$
    Taking the logarithm base $10$ throughout the inequality we obtain the following;
    $$2m &lt k\cdot\log n &lt 2m+1$$
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px;" class="formatp">
    Now, a clever or rather useful way to rewrite $k\cdot\log n$ would be to write in terms of the floor function and fractional part $($you'll appreciate it later$)$ and that is;
    $$2m &lt k\lfloor \log n\rfloor + k\{\log n\} &lt 2m+1$$
    The key observation is to see that $\lfloor \log n\rfloor$ is even so our goal will be to construct a $k$ such that $1 &lt k\{\log n\}&lt 2$. The next step is a very natural one and that is to divide the latter inequality by $\{\log n\}$ throughout and we obtain the following key result;
    $$\cfrac{1}{\{\log n\}}&lt k&lt \cfrac{2}{\{\log n\}}$$</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;" class="formatp">
    But, how do we confirm the existence of such $k$? It's surprisingly simple! Consider the distance between the points $1 /\{\log n\}$ and $2/\{\log n\}$ which is always more than $1$ that's because $\{\}:\mathbb{R}\to [0,1).$ Hence $n$ is not froggy. For a rigorous proof of the existence of an integer in an interval with a size more than $1$, consider the below lemma.
    </p>
    
    <p class="formatp">
        <b>Lemma 1.</b> <i>Consider an open interval $(a,b)$ in $\mathbb{R}$ $($it could be open or closed, doesn't really matter$)$, if the size of the interval is more than $1$ then there exists an integer in the interval.</i><br>
        <i>Proof.</i> Note that there is a number $r\in(a,b)$ such that $r+1\in(a,b)$. A simple construction of an integer in the interval would be $\lfloor r+1\rfloor$.  $\square$<br> Recall the fact that, $x-1&lt \lfloor x\rfloor \le x$ for any choice of $x\in\mathbb{R}$. So, we can peacefully conclude that our initial claim is true. $\square$
    </p>

    <h3 class="head3">Remarks</h3>
    <p class="formatp">
        If we are interested in investigaing the least power of $n\ne 10^{\ell}$ such that $n$ has even number of digits, we have a nice upper bound that is $2/\{\log n\}$.
